## Gone Therapist: A Harsh Critique

This story has potential, but it's drowning in its own clich√©s and narrative pitfalls. The premise, while intriguing, is presented in a clunky, overly-descriptive manner. Here's a breakdown of the problems and how to fix them:

**1.  "Tell, Don't Show":** The writing is heavy on exposition and lacks vivid imagery and sensory details.  You're *telling* us about Yara's empathy and her husband's betrayal, but we don't *feel* it.  

* **Example:** "She saw herself in him, the same vulnerability, the same need for connection, the same fear of losing what she held most dear." 
* **Instead:**  Show us a specific moment where Yara struggles with her empathy, perhaps a flashback to her own marriage, where a sound, a smell, or a look triggers her past pain. 

**2. Flat Dialogue:** The dialogue is predictable and lacks nuance.  Mark's confessions feel like a script, and Yara's responses are robotic and emotionally detached.

* **Example:** "You need to take responsibility," Yara pressed, her voice firm but laced with a hint of understanding, a subtle manipulation designed to trigger his guilt and remorse. 
* **Instead:** Let their emotions drive the conversation.  Yara might be angry, but she could mask it with a cool, controlled tone, while Mark could deflect with sarcastic humor or defensiveness.  

**3.  Passive Voice:** The use of passive voice makes the story feel flat and lifeless. 

* **Example:** "His words hung heavy in the air, a confession laced with a self-loathing that seemed both genuine and calculated."
* **Instead:** "He let his words hang in the air, a confession laced with a self-loathing that seemed both genuine and calculated."

**4.  Overly Dramatic Language:** The story is peppered with overly dramatic language ("a siren call," "a tidal wave of emotion," "a chilling thought"). It's too much, too fast.

* **Example:** "The resemblance to Michael, the uncanny echoes of his features, his voice, his presence, sent a shiver down Yara's spine."
* **Instead:** "She felt a prickle of unease, a familiar chill in the air, as if a ghost from her past had walked into the room." 

**5.  Unclear Narrative Focus:** It's difficult to determine the main narrative thread. Is this about Yara's revenge or Mark's manipulation?  Is this a therapist's ethical struggle or a story of obsession and betrayal?  

**6.  Lack of Suspense:** The story unfolds predictably. We know from the beginning that Yara plans to "save" Emily, and the reader anticipates her actions.  

**To Fix These Problems:**

* **Show, don't tell:**  Use sensory details, flashbacks, and internal monologues to immerse the reader in the characters' experiences.
* **Create dynamic dialogue:**  Let the characters' emotions drive the conversation, use subtext, and avoid predictable exchanges.
* **Employ active voice:** This makes the story more direct and engaging. 
* **Control the use of metaphors:** Only use them if they add depth and meaning to the story.
* **Focus your narrative:** Decide what the core conflict of the story is and make sure all the plot points serve that conflict. 
* **Build tension and suspense:**  Introduce unexpected twists and turns. Don't reveal Yara's plan too early.  

**Remember:**

* **Character study:** Explore the internal struggles of both Yara and Mark. What are their motivations? What are their fears and desires? 
* **Themes:**  What are the overarching themes of your story? Are they about betrayal, redemption, control, or the nature of empathy?
* **Suspense:**  Keep the reader guessing. Don't let them anticipate every plot twist.
* **Show, don't tell:**  This is the key to making your story come alive.

This is a harsh critique, but it's intended to be constructive. With some careful revision and a focus on the elements discussed above, you can transform this story into a compelling, suspenseful thriller.
